        <center><p>Abrosexual refers to an individual whose sexuality is changing or fluid. One can change between any sexualities, whether is be monosexual, multisexual, allosexual or asexual spectrum, etc. The gender(s) one is attracted to typically change, and the intensity of the attraction or the way one feels attraction may change as well. For example, someone could be gay one day, then be asexual the next, then polysexual the next. For some the changes may be erratic and for others they may be regular. Some abrosexual people may be fluid between all or a large number of sexualities, while others may only be fluid between a few. Because of their inconsistent attraction, some abrosexual people may not feel compelled to seek out a relationship or may prefer a wavership.</p></center>
